## Mathematics

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

> This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $`\sqrt{\$4}`$

> To split <span>$</span>100 in half, we calculate $100/2$

Our company🌐
Hello, and welcome to the Heart of Stone Clothing! We would like to share with you the story of how our non-profit clothing company came to be.

Heart of Stone Clothing was founded in 2008 by a group of friends who wanted to make a difference in the world. They were inspired by the idea of using art as a tool for social change, and they decided to create a clothing line that would support various causes and charities.

The name Heart of Stone comes from the idea that we can be strong and resilient in the face of adversity, but also compassionate and caring towards others. Our logo is a heart-shaped stone that symbolizes our values and mission.

Our products are made from organic and recycled materials, and we donate 50% of our profits to different organizations that work on issues such as environmental protection, human rights, animal welfare, education, health, and more. We also partner with local artisans and communities to create unique and ethical designs that reflect their cultures and traditions.

Our goal is to create clothing that is not only stylish and comfortable, but also meaningful and impactful. We want to empower our customers to express themselves and their passions through their outfits, and to inspire them to join us in making the world a better place.

We hope you enjoyed learning more about our history and vision. If you want to support us and our causes, you can visit our website at **heartofstoneclothing.com** and browse our collections. You can also follow us on social media and join our community of like-minded people.

Thank you for reading and stay tuned for more updates from Heart of Stone Clothing!
